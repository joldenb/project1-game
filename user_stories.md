USER STORIES

-When the User first arrives at the site, they will notice a few things...

	FIRST IMPRESSION
	1. Title of 'Maze Game' (already describes what it is about)

	2. Instructions that clearly define the game
			-use your mouse cursor as your game piece
			-when you click start the timer will begin and you will have that much time to complete the maze
			-green tiles = correct path
			-red tiles = warning you are going off the path
			-if you go outside a green and red tile you will lose 1 life for each white tile you hover over
			-if time runs out you will lose a life and have to restart
			-reach the end without losing all your lives and before time runs out to complete that level.

	3. They will see that they have a # of lives and a timer (should be relatively straight forward)
	4. User will also see that they are starting at Level 1
	5. The user will see a game board with visible tiles that clearly define the start and end of the maze
	6. User will also notice a little footer at the bottom that says who the game was created by

	GAME PLAY
	//the layout of this game is very obvious and straightforward (so I think)
	1. If the player hovers over the board before pressing start they will notice that nothing happens
	2. The instructions, visible 'start' button, and lack of feedback on page will prompt them to press the start button
	3. once the start button is pressed....
			-the timer will start 
			-the first tile right of the start button will light up green when they move on to it (this is also the only tile direction they can go so it is an obvious first choice.)
			-(potential)-have some sort of alert that the timer has started (big bold border, pop up message, game board slightly changes color)
	4.The first level is quite simple with only a couple of turns in the maze.
			-as the user moves through the game the correct green path that they took will be remembered until they reach the end. (this gives a sense of direction and the player won't be completely lost....they can see clear progress.)
			-they will notice that if they hit a red tile it will only flash on for a second.
			-Green means GO, red means WARNING- obvious queues in real life
			-Making it through the first level should be quite simple (if it is really hard I can increase the time and lives)
			-After completing the first level or if they die trying, the player will have a very clear idea of the object of the game
			-Everyone has done a maze before so it isn't something you need to teach someone.
			-Also the finishing tile will be a checkered flag of sorts (this signifies a finish line and implies that it is also a race.)
			-Game will prompt level won and reveal the next level. The user won't have to discover where to go because it will be very clear.
