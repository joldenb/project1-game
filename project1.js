//things I want to do...

//make a timer of 15 seconds for level 1
//make a timer of 30 seconds for level 2
//make a timer of 60 seconds for level 3

//when timer is up announce that a life is lost and to try again.

//if a player moves outside of the red cells subtract 1 player life (10 to start)
//when the player hovers over the finish square make a level passed for 1 and 2 and 'game won' for level 3.
